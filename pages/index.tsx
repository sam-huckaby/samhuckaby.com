One of the best examples of these kinds of app frameworks is Laravel, an opinionated PHP framework that lets you build a complete app in virtually seconds. I love Laravel, so I am working to bring a similar sort of experience to OCaml, so that we can rapidly prototype project ideas in 'the beautiful language'.",

        <p className='py-2'>A curious developer and people person who likes to build new things. I enjoy making "techie" understandable to regular people. I have spent the last decade working in web technologies like Angular, Node, React, and NextJS both in team member and team lead roles. I love a challenge, whether itâ€™s learning a new programming language or a new technical stack. I love to help other developers reach their full potential.</p>
        <p className='py-2'>I am always learning, usually a new programming language or framework. Currently I am learning OCaml and Go, and experimenting with the Laravel framework. I plan to learn Rust next, once I have a good project to work on. My own experience makes me fond of indie hacking and I am currently working on tooling that will make it easier to take OCaml web apps to production faster. You can learn more about my current silly side projects below.</p>
